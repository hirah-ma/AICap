## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me explore:
- 📦 Integrating external packages in Flutter (`image_picker`, `google_generative_ai`)
- 🔐 Securely using and managing API keys
- 🎭 Using `AnimationController` and `FadeTransition` in Flutter for smooth UI
- 🧠 Working with **multimodal models** (images + text input to Gemini)
- 🧰 State management using `setState` for real-time UI updates
- 🔄 Asynchronous operations (`async`/`await`) in real apps
